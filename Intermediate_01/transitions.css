    Transitions:
    ------------
    - CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.
    - Moving from Initial State to Final State that entire process is known as transition.

    * Difference between animation and transition:
    ----------------------------------------------
    - transition is the movement from source to destination (here only two states are involved - i.e. Initial and Final)
    - but animation is the series of complex movements or set of transitions (which includes multiple states including initial, final or intermediate etc)

    Note:
    -----
    - Animation is the super entity and transition is the child entity.

    Properties:
    -----------
    . transition
    . transition-delay
    . transition-duration
    . transition-property
    . transition-timing-function

    ## How to Use CSS Transitions?
    ------------------------------
    - To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:

    * the CSS property you want to add an effect to
    * the duration of the effect
    
    Note: If the duration part is not specified, the transition will have no effect, because the default value is 0.

    * The following example shows a 100px * 100px red <div> element. The <div> element has also specified a transition effect for the width property, with a duration of 2 seconds:

    Ex:
    ---
    div {
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        background: red;
        transition: width 2s;
    }

    - The transition effect will start when the specified CSS property (width) changes value.
    - Now, let us specify a new value for the width property when a user mouses over the <div> element:

    div:hover {
        width: 300px;
    }

    * Change Several Property Values
    
    The following example adds a transition effect for both the width and height property, with a duration of 2 seconds for the width and 4 seconds for the height:

    Ex:
    ---
    div {
        transition: width 2s, height 4s;
    }

    # Specify the Speed Curve of the Transition:
    --------------------------------------------
    - The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.
    - The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:

    . ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
    . linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
    . ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
    . ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
    . ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
    . cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function
    
    The following example shows some of the different speed curves that can be used:

    Ex:
    ---
    #div1 {transition-timing-function: linear;}
    #div2 {transition-timing-function: ease;}
    #div3 {transition-timing-function: ease-in;}
    #div4 {transition-timing-function: ease-out;}
    #div5 {transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;}

    # Delay the Transition Effect:
    ------------------------------
    - The transition-delay property specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect.
    - The following example has a 1 second delay before starting:

    div {
        transition-delay: 1s;
    }

    # Transition + Transformation:
    ------------------------------
    The following example adds a transition effect to the transformation:

    div {
        transition: width 2s, height 2s, transform 2s;
    }

    ## More Examples:
    -----------------

    - The CSS transition properties can be specified one by one, like this:

    Ex:
    ---
    div {
        transition-property: width;
        transition-duration: 2s;
        transition-timing-function: linear;
        transition-delay: 1s;
    }

    or by using the shorthand property transition:

    Ex:
    ---
    div {
        transition: width 2s linear 1s;
    }
