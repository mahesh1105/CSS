/*
    * span is an inline element, it will take width as per the content inside it
      irrespective of whatever width or height you give to it, it will not change and take only the necessary height and width
      not like block level element, which takes whole window width
    
    Box Model:
    ----------
    - It is used when talking about design and layout.

    - The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: content, padding, borders and margins.
    - Everything is rendered in a box model, either it is text, image, icon or anything

    . Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
    . Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
    . Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
    . Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

    Padding is the Area between the border and content
    Margin is the Area between border and outside window (another box or browser window)

    By default, there will be some margin and padding added by the browser
    Best Practice is to set both of them to zero using Universal Selector

    * CSS Box-Sizing Property:
    --------------------------
    ** CSS Box Sizing:

    - The box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.
    - If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, padding and border are included in the width and height.

    box-sizing: border-box;

    Without the CSS box-sizing Property:
    ------------------------------------

    By default, the width and height of an element is calculated like this:

    width + padding + border = actual width of an element
    height + padding + border = actual height of an element
